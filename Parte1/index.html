        <h2>TIMELINE</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <span>December 28, 1922</span> Stanley Martin Lieber was born in Manhattan, New York City, in the
                apartment of his Romanian-born Jewish immigrant parents, Celia (née Solomon) and Jack Lieber, at the
                corner of West 98th Street and West End Avenue.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>1939</span> With the help of his uncle Robbie Solomon, Lee became an assistant at the new Timely
                Comics division belonging to pulp magazine and comic-book publisher Martin Goodman. Timely, by the
                1960s, would evolve into Marvel Comics.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>1941</span> Stan graduated from writing filler to actual comics with a backup feature, "'Headline'
                Hunter, Foreign Correspondent", two issues later. Lee's first superhero co-creation was the Destroyer,
                in Mystic Comics #6.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>1961</span> The first superheroes Lee and artist Jack Kirby created together were the Fantastic
                Four. The team's immediate popularity led Lee and Marvel's illustrators to produce a cavalcade of new
                titles.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>1963</span> Lee and Bill Everett created, Daredevil; and with Steve Ditko, Doctor Strange and
                Marvel's most successful character, Spider-Man, all of whom lived in a thoroughly shared universe.
